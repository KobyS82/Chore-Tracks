Creating a Full Stack MERN Social Media App
This app is envisioned as a chore-tracking site where you can add friends and create families that will have classes of chores that users can create (or add a preset) and get notifications when the chore is needing to be done.
The chores will be set where it will be a click of a button for when the chore is completed, but it will then automatically track when it is done and find the next chore day within the allotted time for the chore and create a new countdown.
